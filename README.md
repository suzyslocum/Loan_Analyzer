# Loan Analyzer

A lending startup engaged in microcredit loans needs help valuing these loans. I will automate a process that does just that by creating a Python program. This program automates the tasks associated with valuing microlending loans. Specifically, it automates the calculations, analyzes loan data, performs financial calculations, conditionally filters lists of loans, and saves the results.
